# Important - please read

This map is not intended to make VHF areas easy to 'click'.

Areas (features) should *ONLY* cover their reposonsible area. Nothing more.

Think of when you leave a lock/marina or just passed a bridge. 

You want to be able to look ahead and 'see' the next channel, not what you've just passed.

## Editing info
The only shapes to use are &#11203 (polygon) and &#9679; (circles). No 'points' as it's impossible to tell if you'll pass through the point.

When you're done editing, you can 'upload' your changes using the ![26px](public/upload.png) icon.

#### Lock
Only draw the full locks chambers (typically rectangles). It's OK to cross over land for multiple chambers

#### Bridge
Only draw under the bridge, fully from side to side (typically rectangles). This is important as for future routing to be able to see which areas will be crossed.

#### Marina
Draw a shape that covers the water (and land if that's simpler) of the marina.

#### VTS
Here it is important to cover the documented coordinates of the VTS as close as possible. In case of half circles on sea towards a port, it's ok to make it less detailed to reduce points)

#### Types
- VTS - Vessel Traffic Service
- VTS Radar Support - Specific channel for radar support in a VTS
- Lock
- Bridge
- Marina
- Area - non VTS larger area
