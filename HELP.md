### Drawing the coordinates on the map
Draw the VHF channel area as a polygon.
For different types there are different instructions for drawing:

#### Lock
Only draw the full locks chambers (typically rectangles). It's OK to cross over land for multiple chambers

#### Bridge
Only draw under the bridge, fully from side to side (typically rectangles). This is important as for future routing to be able to see which areas will be crossed.

#### Marina
Free figure polygon that covers only the (land and water if that's simpler) marina

#### VTS
Here it is important to cover the documented coordinates of the VTS as close as possible. In case of half circles on sea towards a port, it's ok to make it less detailed to reduce points)

#### Area
Draw where it applies.
