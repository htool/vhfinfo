# VHFinfo help

## Viewing info

### Layers
You can bring a layer to back by pressing the right mouse button.

### Map coordinates
You can change format of the map coordinates by clicking the coordinates.

## Adding information
To add information you locate the area you want to edit.
Press the pencil icon in the top left corner to go to the edit page for that country info.

## Editing info
The only shapes to use are 'polygons' and 'circles'. No 'points' as it's impossible to tell if you'll pass through the point.

### Drawing the coordinates on the map
#### Lock
Only draw the full locks chambers (typically rectangles). It's OK to cross over land for multiple chambers

#### Bridge
Only draw under the bridge, fully from side to side (typically rectangles). This is important as for future routing to be able to see which areas will be crossed.

#### Marina
Draw a shape that covers the water (and land if that's simpler) of the marina.

#### VTS
Here it is important to cover the documented coordinates of the VTS as close as possible. In case of half circles on sea towards a port, it's ok to make it less detailed to reduce points)

#### Area
Draw where it applies.

### Adding details
Click a feature to edit the details.

#### Types
- VTS - Vessel Traffic Service
- Lock
- Bridge
- Marina
- Berth - non marina area where berth request by VHF is required or possible
- Area - non VTS larger area

## Other work based on the data seen here
The VHFinfo project was started to be able to 'see' nearby VHF VTS areas, bridge and lock information using [SignalK](https://www.signalk.org/).
For example like this: ![](documentation/pictures/vhfinfo.png)
Underlaying data can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/htool/vhfinfo).
