To add information you locate the area you want to edit.
Press the pencil icon in the top left corner to go to the edit page for that country info.

## Editing info
The only shapes to use are 'polygons' and 'circles'. No 'points' as it's impossible to tell if you'll pass through the point.

### Drawing the coordinates on the map
#### Lock
Only draw the full locks chambers (typically rectangles). It's OK to cross over land for multiple chambers

#### Bridge
Only draw under the bridge, fully from side to side (typically rectangles). This is important as for future routing to be able to see which areas will be crossed.

#### Marina
Draw a shape that covers the water (and land if that's simpler) of the marina.

#### VTS
Here it is important to cover the documented coordinates of the VTS as close as possible. In case of half circles on sea towards a port, it's ok to make it less detailed to reduce points)

#### Area
Draw where it applies.
